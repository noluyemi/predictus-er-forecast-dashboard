An AI-driven dashboard that predicts emergency room (ER) surges to support U.S. hospital staffing and emergency preparedness

# PredictUS: ER Surge Forecast Dashboard

## Overview
**PredictUS** is an AI-powered public health dashboard that forecasts **emergency room (ER) surges** across the U.S. This tool supports hospitals, policymakers, and emergency response teams in **proactive planning**, staffing, and resource allocation, particularly during public health crises.

Created to bridge the gap between real-time healthcare demand and hospital preparedness, PredictUS empowers decision-makers with **data-driven foresight**.

## Problem Statement
Overcrowded emergency rooms lead to:
- Delayed treatments and mismanaged care
- Burnout among clinical staff
- Inadequate emergency response

Despite available hospital data, thereâ€™s a lack of **predictive systems** that synthesize it into meaningful, forward-looking insights. This project aims to change that.
