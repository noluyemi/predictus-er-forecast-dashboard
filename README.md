# PredictUS: ER Surge Forecast Dashboard

> *An AI-driven dashboard that forecasts emergency room (ER) surges to support U.S. hospital staffing and emergency preparedness.*

---

##  Overview

**PredictUS** is an AI-powered public health dashboard that forecasts emergency room (ER) surges across the U.S. This tool supports hospitals, policymakers, and emergency response teams in proactive planning, staffing, and resource allocationâ€”particularly during public health crises.

Created to bridge the gap between real-time healthcare demand and hospital preparedness, PredictUS empowers decision-makers with **data-driven foresight**.

##  Problem Statement

Overcrowded emergency rooms lead to:

-  Delayed treatments and mismanaged care  
-  Burnout among clinical staff  
-  Inadequate emergency response  

Despite abundant hospital and syndromic data, there is a lack of predictive systems that synthesize it into actionable, forward-looking insights.

**This project aims to change that.**

##  Forecast Dashboard

The `app.py` file in the `/dashboards/` directory contains the Streamlit dashboard script used to visualize and forecast ER visit trends in the U.S. from 2016 to 2025.

The dashboard includes:
- A line chart displaying actual ER visits from 2016 to 2022.
- A simple linear regression forecast projecting trends from 2023 to 2025.
- A visual tool to support proactive hospital resource planning.
