# PredictUS: ER Surge Forecast Dashboard

> *An AI-driven dashboard that forecasts emergency room (ER) surges to support U.S. hospital staffing and emergency preparedness.*

---

##  Overview

**PredictUS** is an AI-powered public health dashboard that forecasts emergency room (ER) surges across the U.S. This tool supports hospitals, policymakers, and emergency response teams in proactive planning, staffing, and resource allocation—particularly during public health crises.

Created to bridge the gap between real-time healthcare demand and hospital preparedness, PredictUS empowers decision-makers with **data-driven foresight**.

---

##  Problem Statement

Overcrowded emergency rooms lead to:

-  Delayed treatments and mismanaged care  
-  Burnout among clinical staff  
-  Inadequate emergency response  

Despite abundant hospital and syndromic data, there is a lack of predictive systems that synthesize it into actionable, forward-looking insights.

**This project aims to change that.**

##  Forecast Dashboard

The `app.py` file in the `/dashboards/` directory contains the Streamlit dashboard script used to visualize and forecast ER visit trends in the U.S. from 2016 to 2025.

The dashboard includes:
- A line chart displaying actual ER visits from 2016 to 2022.
- A simple linear regression forecast projecting trends from 2023 to 2025.
- A visual tool to support proactive hospital resource planning.
