# PredictUS: ER Surge Forecast Dashboard

> *An AI-driven dashboard that forecasts emergency room (ER) surges to support U.S. hospital staffing and emergency preparedness.*

---

##  Overview

**PredictUS** is an AI-powered public health dashboard that forecasts emergency room (ER) surges across the U.S. This tool supports hospitals, policymakers, and emergency response teams in proactive planning, staffing, and resource allocationâ€”particularly during public health crises.

Created to bridge the gap between real-time healthcare demand and hospital preparedness, PredictUS empowers decision-makers with **data-driven foresight**.

---

##  Problem Statement

Overcrowded emergency rooms lead to:

-  Delayed treatments and mismanaged care  
-  Burnout among clinical staff  
-  Inadequate emergency response  

Despite abundant hospital and syndromic data, there is a lack of predictive systems that synthesize it into actionable, forward-looking insights.

**This project aims to change that.**
