# Project Outline: PredictUS – ER Surge Forecast Dashboard

##  Vision

**PredictUS** aims to build a real-time, AI-driven dashboard that forecasts **emergency room (ER) surges** across U.S. hospitals. The dashboard will help healthcare institutions and public health agencies improve emergency preparedness, reduce patient wait times, and allocate clinical staff and resources more efficiently.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Develop a predictive model for ER surges using public health and environmental datasets
- Visualize predicted surges by hospital, region, and state
- Deliver a user-friendly dashboard tailored for health officials and emergency planners
- Offer insights that support proactive staffing and emergency response decisions

---

##  Core Features

-  **ER Surge Prediction**: Time series or ML-based model to forecast spikes in ER visits
-  **Geospatial Mapping**: Regional and hospital-specific forecasting
-  **Dynamic Visualizations**: Interactive charts, overlays (e.g., flu outbreaks, events)
-  **Data Source Integration**: APIs (CDC, HHS Protect, FEMA, local hospital reports)
-  **Scalable Backend**: Clean, modular codebase to allow future model and UI upgrades
